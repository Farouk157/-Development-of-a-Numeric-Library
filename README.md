# Development of a Numeric Library
## Project Objective:

To design and implement a versatile numeric library utilizing the power of Modern C++ templates, demonstrating a solid understanding of template programming, arithmetic operations, and operator overloading.

## Core Features:

### Numeric Operations: The library will feature the following key numeric operations:

1- sum: Returns the summation of its arguments whatever their number and their data types


2- sub: Returns the difference of its arguments whatever their number and their data types


3- max: Returns the maximum value among its arguments 


4- min: Returns the minimum value among its arguments


### Used the Meta Programming concept all functions implemented using C++ Templates, allowed them to accept one or more paramters
